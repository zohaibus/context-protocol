## Using the One-Pager

The executive summary PDF is designed for:

- **Sharing with managers** who need to understand the approach
- **Team discussions** about AI workflow standards
- **Interview artifacts** demonstrating systems thinking
- **Quick reference** during presentations

It covers:
- The problem (stateless LLMs, context loss)
- The insight (you are the operating system)
- The architecture (CPU / RAM / OS)
- The system (5 commands, 3 constraint tags)
- The workflow (start session / end session)
- Why it works (comparison table)
