## Creating Your Own

The key sections in any thread state:

- **Status** — Where you are now
- **Locked Decisions** — What's decided and won't change
- **Rejected Ideas** — What you've ruled out (so AI doesn't suggest them)
- **Constraints** — Hard limits that can't be violated
- **Today's Focus** — What you're working on this session

Start simple. Add sections as you need them.
