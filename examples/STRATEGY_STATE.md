<locked_decisions>
1. Focus: Enterprise customers (not SMB)
2. Primary metric: Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
3. No new product lines in Q1 — optimize existing
4. Hiring freeze continues through Q1
5. Budget: $500K for Q1 initiatives
</locked_decisions>

<rejected_ideas>
1. SMB expansion — rejected, enterprise has better unit economics
2. New mobile app — rejected, web app engagement is sufficient
3. Acquisition strategy — rejected, focus on organic growth
4. New pricing tiers — rejected, current pricing not the bottleneck
</rejected_ideas>

<constraints>
• Q1 budget: $500K total
• Team: 12 engineers, 3 PMs, 2 designers
• No new hires until Q2
• Must show NRR improvement by end of Q1
• Board review in March
</constraints>

<today_focus>Finalize the top 3 Q1 initiatives</today_focus>

## Current Status

**Stage:** Planning
**Focus:** Q1 initiative prioritization
**Blockers:** Waiting on final budget confirmation

---

## Decisions Made

1. **Enterprise focus over SMB** — 3x higher LTV, lower churn
2. **NRR as primary metric** — Board cares about expansion revenue
3. **No new product lines** — Optimize before expanding
4. **Hiring freeze continues** — Runway preservation
5. **$500K Q1 budget** — Split across top 3 initiatives

---

## Rejected Ideas

1. ~~SMB expansion~~ — Unit economics don't work without scale
2. ~~Mobile app rebuild~~ — Web engagement metrics are strong
3. ~~M&A exploration~~ — Board wants organic growth proof first
4. ~~New pricing tiers~~ — Win rate isn't the problem, activation is
5. ~~Platform partnerships~~ — Too early, need more enterprise logos
6. ~~AI features~~ — Not a differentiator in our market yet

## Open Questions

- [ ] Which 3 initiatives get the budget?
- [ ] How to measure NRR improvement mid-quarter?

- [x] Board presentation date — Resolved: March 15

## Constraints

• Budget: $500K total for Q1
• Team: 12 eng, 3 PM, 2 design (no new hires)
